**H**ighly unportable b**A**sh s**C**ript for drawing in terminal O**K**?
## Instollation
Just type *make*, this will compile the programs needed by ***hack.sh***. One importante thing is that *git* for **Windows** has automatic settings that add *carriage return* to every new line, if you try to run the script from *Cygwin* for example, in that case either change git settings or download instead of cloning the repository.

## Compatibility
:) Joking, it's possible to rewrite the all stuff using C libraries, but I don't have such ambitions.
The main reason for writing this stuff was to learn bash scripting and to have fun. The "recommended"
terminals are MATE and Gnome plus Cygwin for Windows it also runs on Konsole and xterm, but there are
some issues with mouse tracking and colours I couldn't figure out.
Coz can't give you guarantee that this is a bug free program that will run on e v e r y terminal and bash version (actually probably can guarantee you the opposite) decided to make a short video showing the intended functionality (it was supposed to have some bgr music but one can barely hear anything, have to fix that in the future, for now you can listen to your own music) the file is here [video](pix/Screencast.mp4). You can view it with Chrome or Chromium browser.
