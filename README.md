# hack
**H**ighly unportable b**A**sh s**C**ript for drawing in terminal O**K**?
## Instollation
Just type make, this will compile the programs needed by hack.sh. One importante thing
is that git for **Windows** has automatic settings that add carriage return to every
new line, if you try to run the script from *Cygwin* for example, in that case either
change git settings or download instead of cloning the repository.
